With my previous degree in Environmental Science, I chose to focus on a subject that I am passionate about - Recycling. I have yet to find a recyle processing facility that provides publicly availble data revolved around materials entering the facility and what portion actually gets processed. Hence , the objective of my project is to allow analysis of how much recyclable material enters the facility, how much is actually processed, and how much is sold for re-use. For example, someone would be able to query how much pre-recylcled (raw) glass was gathered in the facility, how much of that glass was then successfully recycled, and how much was sold for re-use. Overall cost and sales will be gathered as well, over a given time period.
Ideally, the idea behind this project format could be implemented in recycling factories which would allow for the general public to follow the 'inventory' of a given recycling facility.

*Note: This project is just a small scale prototype for bigger project and currently only uses fake data.*


At the start of the Notebook you can delete the database if it exists and then rebuild it to verify that all the queries and such work.
